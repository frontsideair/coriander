# Coriander

This project is for tracking habits, or whatever you like. It's a color calendar.

## Usage

Use the plus button to add a color. Pick a date. Use colors you created to color the selected date. If you want to clear a date, use the trash button. If you mess it up too much, use the button at the bottom to clear everything. You can't edit or delete colors.

## Stack

It's a client-rendered app built with React, Vite, and React Aria Components. Data is stored on local storage.

## Contribution

No maintenance intended. Feel free to report bugs and feature requests though.
